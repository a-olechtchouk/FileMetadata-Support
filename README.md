# Importing a file
To view file metadata, you can either:
1. Drag and drop a file anywhere in the app window.
2. Or, you can left-click the area around "click to import a file" to open the file import panel. The file import panel lets you navigate and select the file you want to import manually.

# Viewing file metadata
Once file metadata is loaded, you can:
- Use the search bar to filter metadata.
- Scroll through the list of metadata.
- Hide or show metadata sections by left-clicking on the chevron that appears to the right of each section title when you hover over it.
- Increase or decrease window size.

# Settings
Click the "gear" button to view app settings. In settings, you can change the output language, hide/show duplicate metadata tags, and more.

# Contact
If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to [contact us.](mailto:FileMetadataSupport@proton.me)
